/// Developers can restrict access to functions in their own package with a Cap that can be locked into an Account. 
/// The Cap can be borrowed upon approval and used in other move calls within the same ptb before being returned.
/// 
/// The Cap pattern uses the object type as a proof of access, the object ID is never checked.
/// Therefore, only one Cap of a given type can be locked into the Smart Account.
/// And any Cap of that type can be returned to the Smart Account after being borrowed.
/// 
/// A good practice to follow is to use a different Cap type for each function that needs to be restricted.
/// This way, the Cap borrowed can't be misused in another function, by the person executing the intent.
/// 
/// e.g.
/// 
/// public struct AdminCap has key, store {}
/// 
/// public fun foo(_: &AdminCap) { ... }
